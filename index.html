      <p class="mb-4">
        I’m a data scientist with 10+ years of experience turning messy data into clear insights.
        I believe data becomes powerful when it drives action—whether through a dashboard, an experiment,
        or a single sentence that helps someone make a better decision.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        I specialize in product analytics, A/B testing, and building end-to-end data workflows that turn raw data into impact.
        I’ve worked in both startups and large companies, often owning the full stack: designing the analysis,
        working with stakeholders, writing the SQL and Python, and delivering clear recommendations that influence product and strategy.
        I’m especially drawn to ambiguous problems, where the path isn’t obvious but the opportunity is real.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Outside of work, I love to run, play soccer, pickleball, tennis, lift weights, and read books.
        I also run a nonprofit with my wife that supports underserved communities.
        These parts of my life give me energy, purpose, and perspective.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        This site is a collection of my work, thoughts, and experiments.
        You’ll find case studies, technical breakdowns, and tools I’ve built to help others move faster with data.
        Everything is open—feel free to explore, use the code, and reach out if you want to connect.
